# GPU-generated Keyframe Animation

A WebGL program for displaying GPU-generated animations through interpolation of vertex positions between the predefined keyframes of a 3D object. Demo can be found [here](http://www.student.dtu.dk/~s192771/webgl-keyframe-animation/).

## Description

This program was created in the scope of a project for the Computer Graphics course at the Technical University of Denmark. It can load keyframes of a 3D object and interpolate positions of the vertices between the frames on the GPU and display the resulting animation. The model can be additionally scaled, translated, rotated and lighting effects can be applied. An in-depth description of the project, methods and results can be found [here](https://www.student.dtu.dk/~s192771/KeyframeAnimation.pdf).
